        <p>luna's candy REVIEWS updated 2020</p>

        <h1>candys</h1>
        <p>
        trancetto cocoa: 7/10 pretty good<br>
        two layers of cake-flavored palm-sized cakes with a chocolate filling in the middle<br>
        it'd be 7.5 but they skimp on the chocolate goo<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        ferrero rocher: 9.6/10 excellent<br>
        a whole hazelnut, covered in nutella, encased in a thin round wafer, which is coated in milk chocolate sprinkled with hazelnut bits<br>
        it's an experience<br>
        the gold wrapping makes you feel rich<br>
        -0.4 cuz it's too FRIGGEN expensive<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        giant easter kinder egg: kinder egg<br>
        it's a big kinder egg<br>
        if u like kinder eggs this is pretty good but maybe too much<br>
        the toys inside are cheap movie promotional garbage as usual but bigger cheap garbage<br>
        the packaging is Too Much and i cant open it without scissors and/or bolt cutter<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        kinder egg: also kinder egg but smaller but 8.4/10 anyway<br>
        it's a kinder egg<br>
        it's kinda hard to eat compared to other candies but the low quality toy inside makes up for it<br>
